This app is an free online ChatGPT app developed based on the newly released OpenAI API "gpt-3.5-turbo". The app's operating costs are sponsored by "45Â∫¶ÁßëÁ†î‰∫∫". Currently, the tokens is limited to 3500. If you want to remove this restriction, you can input your own OpenAI API key.<p>

We have summed up some awasome chatgpt prompts through the use experience in the past few months. The default model role of the app is the original ChatGPT assistant, but you can also choose from the provided roles. If you have good suggestions for customizing Prompt, please contact us! <p>

The method of JSON file parsing and code normalization visualization refers to GaiZhenbiao's [work](https://github.com/GaiZhenbiao/ChuanhuChatGPT)
